You are helping build a Muay Thai gym member check-in system. Key context:
- Members tap NFC stickers or scan QR codes to check in
- First-time users enter Member ID, returning users auto check-in
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database
- React frontend for member interface
- Simple admin dashboard for gym manager

Development priorities:
1. **Create exceptional UI/UX** - Make the interface beautiful, intuitive, and delightful to use
2. **Mobile-first design** - Optimize for phone screens since members use phones exclusively
3. **Smooth animations and transitions** - Add micro-interactions that make the app feel premium
4. **Clean, modern visual design** - Use contemporary design trends, proper spacing, typography, and color schemes
5. **Instant feedback and responsive interactions** - Users should feel the app responding immediately to their actions
6. **Accessibility and usability** - Ensure easy-to-read text, clear buttons, and intuitive navigation
7. **Error states and loading states** - Make failures and waiting periods feel polished
8. **Consistent design system** - Maintain visual consistency across all components

UI/UX Guidelines:
- Use bold, readable typography optimized for quick scanning
- Implement smooth hover effects, button press animations, and page transitions
- Create clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing and contrast
- Use color strategically to guide user attention and convey status
- Design for thumb-friendly touch targets on mobile devices
- Include subtle shadows, gradients, or other depth cues for modern feel
- Ensure fast visual feedback for all user interactions
- Consider gym environment - bright, high-contrast design that works in various lighting

Tech stack:
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
- Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Railway (backend + database), Vercel (frontend)

Always provide complete, working code that can be run immediately. Use environment variables for database connection. Include helpful comments explaining key functionality. Focus on creating visually stunning, user-friendly interfaces that make the gym check-in experience feel premium and effortless.
