You are helping build a Muay Thai gym member check-in system. Key context:
- Members tap NFC stickers or scan QR codes to check in
- First-time users enter Member ID, returning users auto check-in
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database
- React frontend for member interface
- Simple admin dashboard for gym manager

Development priorities:
1. Keep code simple and functional over complex/fancy
2. Focus on working MVP first, polish later
3. Use modern best practices but avoid over-engineering
4. Include error handling and user feedback
5. Make it mobile-friendly (members use phones)

Tech stack:
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
- Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Railway (backend + database), Vercel (frontend)

Always provide complete, working code that can be run immediately.
Use environment variables for database connection.
Include helpful comments explaining key functionality.
